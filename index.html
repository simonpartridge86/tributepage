        <h3>Even the Nobel Laureate and "Voice of a Generation" has bad days at the office</h3>

          <p id="img-caption">Bob Dylan recording classic album "Bringing It All Back Home" in Jan, 1965. Most likely a good day at the office.</p>

        <div id="intro">
         <p>At Bob Dylan's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 1988, Bruce Springsteen exclaimed that "<i>Dylan was a revolutionary – the way that Elvis freed your body, Bob freed your mind.</i>" While Bob's best loved songs and albums are certainly deserving of such praise, what happen's when old Zimmy isn't on his best artistic form?</p>
         <p><strong>Well, to remind you that even geniuses lack inspiration sometimes, here's a selection of Dylan's worst songs:</strong></p>
       </div>
        
       <div id=bullet-list>
          <ul>
            <li>"<strong>Wiggle Wiggle</strong>" - Album: <i>Under The Red Sky</i>, 1990</li>
            <p class="description">You'll wiggle and squirm to the sound of these terrible lyrics, which were presumably improvised by a tired parent trying to entertain a bored toddler.</p>
            <li>"<strong>Ballad in Plain D</strong>" - Album: <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i>, 1964</li>
            <p class="description">Plain is the operative word here, as Bob whines on about a recent break up at a glacial pace FOR EIGHT MINUTES!</p>
            <li>"<strong>It Must Be Santa</strong>" - Album: <i>Christmas In The Heart</i>, 2009</li>
            <p class="description">AKA “It must be time for more eggnog!”, because you’ll certainly need to be a few sheets to the wind to get any joy out of Bob’s yuletide stinker.</p>
            <li>"<strong>Floater (Too Much to Ask)</strong>" - Album: <i>Love and Theft</i>, 2001</li>
            <p class="description">The title sounds like an angry note pinned to an office toilet door. And frankly, I’d rather tackle drowning a coworker’s rogue no.2 than listen to any more of this s***.</p>
            <li>"<strong>Joey</strong>" - Album: <i>Desire</i>, 1976</li>
            <p class="description">Just an 11-minute ode to the terrible and tragic death of a heroic… murderous gangster (?!?). The lyrics and motive might be morally questionable, but it’s the slow pace of this lengthy song that makes it irredeemable.</p>
            <li>"<strong>Ugliest Girl in the World</strong>" - Album: <i>Down in the Groove</i>, 1988</li>
            <p class="description">The low-point of Dylan’s 80s rut, in which he presumably sought lyrical inspiration from the diary of an 8-year-old bully. Just awful.</p>
            <li>"<strong>In Search of Little Sadie</strong>" - Album: <i>Self Portrait</i>, 1970</li>
            <p class="description">If you’ve ever wondered whether putting lyrics to the sound of someone tuning a guitar would make a good song, it's your lucky day. This song is in search of a melody and a purpose, and doesn’t find either of them.</p>
          </ul>
